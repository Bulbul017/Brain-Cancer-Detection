# Brain-Cancer-Detection

For a neurologist, it's often boring and a time consuming job to scan through a bunch of MRI scans of human brain just to identify or detect the imminent tumours or cancer prone area. For this reason, I've developed a very simple deep learning based application which can detect both the benign or malignant human brain tumours after learning theit patterns, sizes and locations etc.


# Properties

1. Used Deep Learning Model - Convolutional Neural Network
2. Framework - PyTorch
3. File types - Both Python and Jupyter Notebook File
